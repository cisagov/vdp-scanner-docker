This is a Docker project to scan either the
[GSA current Federal .gov domain list](https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-domains/current-federal.csv)
or a given CSV in the same format with the
[cisagov/hash-http-content](https://github.com/cisagov/hash-http-content)
Python library. Then it will output CSVs with agency and domain level results.

```console
docker build \
  --tag cisagov/vdp-scanner:0.2.0-dev.2 \
  https://github.com/cisagov/vdp-scanner-docker.git#develop
```

## Cross-platform builds ##

To create images that are compatible with other platforms, you can use the
[`buildx`](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) feature of
Docker:

1. Copy the project to your machine using the `Code` button above
   or the command line:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/cisagov/vdp-scanner-docker.git
    cd vdp-scanner-docker
    ```

1. Create the `Dockerfile-x` file with `buildx` platform support:

    ```console
    ./buildx-dockerfile.sh
    ```

1. Build the image using `buildx`:

    ```console
    docker buildx build \
      --file Dockerfile-x \
      --platform linux/amd64 \
      --output type=docker \
      --tag cisagov/vdp-scanner:0.2.0-dev.2 .
    ```
